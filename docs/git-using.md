# Git & GitHub flow

1. `git fetch` to fetch the latest information in the remote repo.

2. `git log origin/dev` to check the git commits in the remote.

3. `git diff HEAD origin/dev` if you want to check changes in the remote.

4. `git rebase` to rebase your local commits on top of the remote commits, or just
   fast-forwarding.
